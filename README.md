# Simple RAG 
This is an exercise on RAG application, based on IBM "Summarize private documents using RAG LangChain and LLMs.ipynb". However, this is different from the IBM version, in following points: 

    - Used marimo notebook
    - Used latest version of Langchain. The IBM used several classes/functions that are no londer part of Langchain package
    - Used OpenRouter API to get access to free LLM models, rather than using IBM Watson models.
